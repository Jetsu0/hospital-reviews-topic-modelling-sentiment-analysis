Overview and goals
This project focuses on turning patient feedback into actionable insights. The main goal is to extract meaningful topics from patient reviews and to pair those themes with sentiment signals. The LDA model surfaces topics by discovering clusters of words that tend to appear together across reviews. The sentiment model uses structured features derived from text to predict sentiment labels or scores.

The approach is designed to be approachable for researchers, data scientists, clinicians, and quality-improvement teams. It emphasizes transparency, interpretability, and reproducibility. The notebook brings together preprocessing, topic modeling, feature engineering, and supervised sentiment classification in a coherent workflow.

What you‚Äôll find in this project
- An end-to-end workflow that starts with raw reviews and ends with topic lists and sentiment predictions.
- A single analysis notebook that documents all steps, decisions, and results.
- Demonstrations of how topic themes align with sentiment signals.
- Clear guidance on how to adapt the workflow to new data or different domains.

How this project helps hospitals and researchers
Hospitals want to listen to patients and respond quickly. This project provides:
- A clear method to identify themes in patient feedback, such as wait times, staff communication, facility cleanliness, and pain management.
- A way to quantify sentiment associated with each theme, enabling prioritization of improvements.
- A framework to compare changes over time or across departments.
- An auditable process that supports evidence-based decision making.

Core ideas and design decisions
- Simplicity with sound NLP practices: the pipeline focuses on a small set of robust techniques that work well with limited labeled data and sizeable unlabeled text.
- Interpretability first: topic models produce human-readable themes, and the sentiment model outputs explanations alongside predictions.
- Reproducibility by design: the notebook contains the full data processing, model training, evaluation, and results, enabling others to replicate the work with their data.
- Modularity: the workflow is modular so you can swap in different preprocessing steps, models, or evaluation methods without rewriting the whole notebook.
- Real-world constraints: the approach acknowledges noisy text, varying review lengths, and domain-specific language.

Data, ethics, and privacy
- Patient reviews often contain sensitive information. This project treats data with care and follows ethical guidelines for NLP on health-related feedback.
- Data handling emphasizes de-identification and aggregation to protect privacy.
- The notebook demonstrates how to document assumptions and scope so that stakeholders understand the limits of insights.
- If you adapt this workflow to real data, ensure you have explicit permission to use the data and follow applicable laws and institutional policies.

Architecture and data flow
- Ingest: textual reviews are loaded from a data source or a provided dataset.
- Preprocess: text normalization, tokenization, stopword handling, and optional lemmatization.
- Topic modeling: apply LDA to discover a fixed set of topics, with coherence and perplexity checks to select a reasonable number of topics.
- Feature engineering: extract features suitable for a supervised model, including TF-IDF representations, n-gram features, and topic distributions as inputs.
- Sentiment modeling: train an XGBoost model to predict sentiment labels or scores, using the features above.
- Evaluation and interpretation: measure performance, inspect topic-word distributions, and visualize sentiment across topics and time.

- machine-learning
- nlp
- online-reviews
- python
- sentiment-analysis
- text-mining
- topic-modelling
- xgboost

Why use both LDA and XGBoost in this project
- LDA reveals underlying themes in the reviews. These themes help explain what patients care about and where to focus improvements.
- XGBoost provides a predictive sentiment signal that can be tied back to the topics. For example, you can examine which topics are associated with strong negative or positive sentiment.
- The combination makes it possible to map subjective feedback to concrete, actionable categories.

Data sources and assumptions
- The notebook is designed to work with a typical corpus of patient reviews. It assumes text is in English or that English preprocessing steps are appropriate for the data.
- If you bring in data from different hospitals or languages, you may need to adjust tokenization, stopword lists, and language models.
- The workflow is robust to varying review lengths and can handle sparse or dense comment collections.

How to run
Prerequisites
- A Python environment with version compatible with popular NLP libraries (commonly Python 3.8‚Äì3.11).
- pip or conda as a package manager.
- Access to the internet if you plan to install dependencies or download data assets.

Setting up
- Create a virtual environment:
  - Python with venv: python -m venv env
  - Activate: source env/bin/activate (Linux/macOS) or env\Scripts\activate (Windows)
- Install dependencies:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - If you use conda: conda env create -f environment.yml
- Ensure you have Jupyter or a notebook runner installed to open the analysis notebook.

Running the analysis notebook
- Open the notebook located at analysis-notebook.ipynb in your Jupyter environment.
- Run cells in order. Do not skip steps that set up data structures, seed values, or model configurations.
- If your data source differs, edit the data loading section to point to your dataset.
- The notebook includes checkpoints and descriptive text that explain the decisions at each step.

Data preparation steps in the notebook
- Clean the text: remove HTML tags, expand contractions, handle misspellings as appropriate.
- Normalize text: lowercase conversion, punctuation handling, digit normalization if needed.
- Tokenize and filter: split into tokens, remove stopwords, optionally apply lemmatization.
- Build a clean corpus: a list of documents ready for modeling.
- Create document-term representations: bag-of-words or TF-IDF representations for downstream models.

Topic modeling with LDA
- Why LDA: it is robust for uncovering latent themes in large text corpora.
- Preprocessing for LDA: often use bigrams/trigrams to capture multi-word concepts, and a limited vocabulary to reduce noise.
- Model selection:
  - Test a range of topic counts (K). Evaluate coherence and diversity.
  - Use coherence metrics (e.g., C_V) to compare models with different K.
  - Monitor perplexity as a secondary indicator, though coherence often aligns better with human interpretability.
- Interpreting topics:
  - Examine top words per topic to label topics meaningfully.
  - Validate topics against real-world hospital domains such as wait times, staff communication, cleanliness, and pain management.
- Topic quality and stability:
  - Run multiple random initializations to assess stability.
  - Consider corpus-specific adjustments like stopword refinement or domain-specific term handling.

Feature engineering for sentiment modeling
- TF-IDF features capture the importance of terms across the corpus.
- N-grams (bigrams, trigrams) help capture phrases like ‚Äúlong wait,‚Äù ‚Äúnurse friendliness,‚Äù and ‚Äúbed sore.‚Äù
- Topic distributions (thematic features) provide interpretable signals to the classifier.
- You can combine these features or use ensembles to improve performance.

Sentiment analysis with XGBoost
- Why XGBoost: it is fast, scalable, and handles a mix of feature types well.
- Target labels:
  - Binary sentiment (positive/negative) or a regression score (e.g., 0‚Äì1 sentiment probability).
  - If your data has neutral labels, you can adapt to a three-class scheme (negative, neutral, positive).
- Training approach:
  - Split data into train/validation/test sets, ensuring temporal or department-level stratification if relevant.
  - Tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, max depth, number of trees, subsampling, and regularization.
  - Use early stopping on the validation set to prevent overfitting.
- Evaluation:
  - Binary classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1.
  - Regression metrics: RMSE, MAE, R^2.
  - Calibration and reliability of probability estimates.
- Interpretability:
  - Feature importance from XGBoost helps identify which words, bigrams, and topics matter most for sentiment.
  - SHAP values can provide local explanations for individual predictions.

Evaluation strategies and metrics
- Topic coherence: measures how semantically interpretable topics are.
- Topic integrity: how stable topic assignments are across random seeds.
- Sentiment accuracy: how well the model predicts labeled sentiment.
- Cross-validation: if data allows, perform cross-validation across folds to gauge generalization.
- Error analysis: examine misclassified instances to identify systematic issues or biases.
- Visualization:
  - Topic-word distributions: show top words per topic.
  - Document-topic distributions: heatmaps indicating topic prevalence per document.
  - Sentiment by topic: bar charts or mosaic plots linking sentiment with themes.
  - Temporal trends: sentiment and topic prevalence over time if timestamps exist.

Reproducibility and environment
- The notebook is designed to be self-contained. It documents all steps, seeds, and configurations.
- Use a fixed random seed for reproducibility where possible.
- Record versions of libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, gensim, and XGBoost) to recreate behavior across environments.
- If you adapt the notebook, maintain a requirements.txt or environment.yml to lock dependencies.
- For large datasets, consider saving intermediate artifacts (e.g., preprocessed corpus, topic-word matrices) to speed up reruns.

How to adapt this workflow to new data
- Data ingestion:
  - Swap the data path or data loader to point to your dataset.
  - Ensure the dataset uses a consistent schema (e.g., one review per row, with columns like "review_text", "timestamp", "department", "rating").
- Preprocessing:
  - Update stopword lists if domain-specific noise appears (medical jargon, abbreviations, etc.).
  - Adjust tokenization to handle slang or shorthand used in patient reviews.
- Topic modeling:
  - Re-run LDA with a range of topic counts.
  - Evaluate coherence in your language and context.
  - Label topics by inspecting top words and, if possible, by spot-checking representative documents.
- Sentiment modeling:
  - If your labels differ (e.g., star ratings), map them to binary or multi-class sentiment labels.
  - Train the model with your feature set. If you have contextual features (department or hospital), consider including them as categorical inputs.
- Evaluation:
  - Define success criteria relevant to your domain (e.g., identifying critical topics with strong negative sentiment that require action).
  - Visualize results to stakeholders in dashboards or slides.

Visualization and interpretation
- Topic visualizations:
  - Word clouds per topic can highlight salient terms.
  - Bar charts show top words by topic probability.
  - Dimensionality reduction plots (e.g., t-SNE or UMAP) can illustrate document embeddings colored by topic or sentiment.
- Sentiment visualization:
  - Distribution plots show how sentiment scores vary overall.
  - Sentiment by topic reveals which themes correlate with negative or positive feedback.
  - Temporal plots illustrate how sentiment and topics evolve over time.
- Dashboards:
  - Build simple dashboards to share insights with clinical teams or quality improvement committees.
  - Include filters by department, time window, or reviewer type to explore the data interactively.

Domain context and practical use
- The themes in patient feedback often cluster around:
  - Access and wait times
  - Communication and empathy from staff
  - Cleanliness and safety standards
  - Pain management and comfort
  - Hospital administration and support services
- Opinion signals linked to these themes help teams prioritize changes with measurable impact.
- This approach supports continuous improvement by providing a transparent link between patient voices and operation tweaks.

Customization and extension possibilities
- Alternative topic models:
  - Replace LDA with Correlated Topic Models or Neural Topic Models if you have the data and computational resources.
  - Compare topic quality and interpretability across methods.
- Enhanced sentiment models:
  - Use transformer-based embeddings (e.g., BERT) to capture deeper semantics, then feed features into a classifier.
  - Incorporate domain-specific lexicons to improve sentiment detection in clinical contexts.
- Multilingual support:
  - Extend preprocessing to handle multiple languages.
  - Apply language-specific stopword removal and lemmatization.
  - Train separate topic models per language or use multilingual embeddings.
- Temporal analysis:
  - Add time-aware modeling to examine shifts in topics and sentiment over quarters or years.
  - Correlate changes with policy updates or events.

FAQ (quick answers)
- What is the main output of this project?
  - A set of topics that describe themes found in hospital reviews and a sentiment prediction model that attaches a sentiment score or label to each review or to topic-based aggregations.
- Do I need a GPU to run this?
  - No. LDA and XGBoost on CPU are common. A GPU can speed up certain steps if you adapt the pipeline to use accelerations, but it is not required for the base notebook.
- Can I use this for other domains?
  - Yes. The workflow applies to any large text collection where you want to uncover themes and predict sentiment. You may need domain-specific preprocessing and vocabulary tuning.
- How do I cite or reference this work?
  - Use the repository URL and the notebook as the primary artifacts. If you publish results, reference the notebook and any supporting figures or code in the docs.

Ethical and practical considerations for practitioners
- Be transparent about limitations: topic models may mix words across domains, and sentiment models can misclassify sarcasm or nuanced statements.
- Maintain data privacy: avoid exposing identifiable patient information in outputs. Use aggregation or anonymization where needed.
- Seek domain feedback: collaborate with hospital staff to validate topic labels and the relevance of the sentiment signals.
- Plan for maintenance: update vocabularies and stopword lists as language evolves and new terms appear in patient feedback.

Implementation notes and tips
- Start simple: run a basic LDA with a small number of topics to understand how topics emerge, then increase complexity gradually.
- Keep a log of experiments: record topic counts, coherence scores, and model configurations to compare results systematically.
- Use robust sampling: for LDA, consider multiple passes and a reasonable alpha and beta (document-topic and topic-word) priors.
- Evaluate interpretability: the best topic model is not the one with the highest coherence alone but the one whose topics align with human interpretation and clinical relevance.
- Document decisions: whenever you change preprocessing steps or feature representations, note why and how it affects results.
